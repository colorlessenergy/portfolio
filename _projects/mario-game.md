## what this is

<!-- This is a recreation of the famous mario game. The controls for the game are
the arrows keys to move and jump. -->

I remember playing Mario when I was younger. Doing this project taught me a lot about how powerful plain JavaScript can be when you understand what is happening. I usually
used atom when I code but I decided to use vs code for the first time on this project. I chose to replicate the Mario to improve some stuff in the game.

## built with

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## challenges

* Camera movement
* Hitboxes
* loading sprites / animations

I managed to do this with just plain JavaScript.
