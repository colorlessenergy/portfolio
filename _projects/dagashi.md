## what this is

<!-- this is a static E-commerce site. This site was made to sell
Japanese candy. This site uses snipcart for the E-commerce. It also has
the Netlify cms. Both snipcart and Netlify cms use Github as the backend -->

I made this site because I wanted to know how to sell items online. I also wanted
to make a static site because I didn't want the monolithic structure that modern sites have today. With these constraints I built a site using snipcart and the netlify cms. I chose to make a static site to make it easier for a potential client to delete and add content to the page.

## built with

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## challenges

* hooking up netlify cms with github
* understanding how to use snipcart
* hooking up snipcart with the use of jekyll for the netlify cms
